# Sparse Matrix Operations Tool
----------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

This is a Python-based tool that performs basic operations on sparse matrices stored in `.txt` files. Supported operations include:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication

The program reads matrix data from text files, processes them as sparse matrices, and allows you to display or save the results in sparse format.

## How to Use

### 1. Download the Repository
- Click the green **"Code"** button on this GitHub repository.
- From **"Local"** option select **"Download ZIP"**.
- Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.

### 2. Open the Project
- Open the extracted folder in a code editor.
- **I recommend you this editor**: [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 3. Make Sure Python is Installed
Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can check by running:
```bash
python --version
```
### 4. Run the python file (make sure both python and text files are found in the same folder)
```bash
python Sparse_Matrix.py
```
### 5. Guiding through the whole process till it's fifnshed
You will be shown the existing files to perform operations on.
**NB.** if you wanna choose Addition or Subtraction, you must choose matrix files with the same dimensions of row and columns. Those are either;** sparseMatrix1.txt to sparseMatrix2.txt** or **matrixA.txt to matrixB.txt**, otherwise you will see dimension error!
and for multiplication only choose **sparseMatrix1 to sparseMatrix3.txt or sparseMatrix2.txt to sparseMatrix3
**

### 6. Example of how result is obtained
on the following image, i perfomed addition on matrixA.txt and matrixB.txt (you can even save the result and new file will be saved under the currrent directory)
